A Growing Musical Diversity and Increased Visibility for French Artists

In 2024, our artists benefited from exceptional visibility, contributing to a 19% increase in export revenue, driven by the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the work of record labels.

Top Trends:

French Music Production: It dominated in 2024, representing more than three-quarters of the best-selling albums in the Top 200 and placing 18 albums in the Top 20. Streaming fueled this success by promoting the rich musical landscape favored by a young, curious audience open to new influences.

Emerging Artists: With 18 debut releases in the Top 200 Albums, these artists also made their mark thanks to their mastery of communication and current trends.

Female artists: Their presence is growing in 2024 with 4 artists in the Top 20 compared to just 1 in 2023, and 41 female projects in the Top 200 Albums. Female artists are also making their mark in the Top Vinyl, Jazz, and Radio charts. This positive development still needs to be consolidated.

Genre diversification: Pop, rock, and French chanson are gaining ground, with four albums in the Top 10 (compared to two in 2023). These artists are enjoying resounding success, both in physical sales and streaming.

Rap, hip-hop, and R&B on the rise: Rap is seeing its market share evolve slightly, while remaining a major genre in France. It represents 53% of the Top 200 albums in 2024, a decrease of 4 points in one year.
