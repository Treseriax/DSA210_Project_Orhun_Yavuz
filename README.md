# DSA210 Project-Correlation Analysis of Rising Street Culture and Youth Social Metrics

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the correlation between the rising popularity of the Street Culture and changes in the Youth Social Metrics by focusing on the United Kingdom over the period 2015-2024. Taking this place and the timeline as a sample it is aimed to make global analysis. First the Street Culture and the Youth Social Metrics will be defined. Street Culture in this context contains elements from several areas such as fashion,music and sports. These independent variables will be assessed as the cultural proxies that define the popularity of the Street Culture. On the other hand substance use and anti-social behaviour will be the dependent variables that will be assessed as the social deterioration proxies. The analysis will be conducted between these two proxies to show if there is a correlation. This project aims to show an important rising social phenomenon which is affecting all individuals through social media, and make individuals gain insight about this phenomenon.

## Plan of the Proejct

After the aim of the project is determined, the data that will be used will be determined and classified with repect to a hypothesis which is prepared in accordance to the goal of the project. The hypothesis must evaluate the possible correlation between the metrics. Then data collection steps will be determined and applied which is followed by data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. After that hypothesis testing steps will be conducted which precedes the final step, applying machine learning methods and presenting the project.

## Explanation of the Data

Focusing on the sample which is trends in United Kingdom between 2015-2024, corresponding proxies can be classified as:
### Independent Variables
1)Penetration of Rap and Hip-Hop music into mainstream British culture.

2)Popularity of urban streetwear in fashion trends.

3)Adoption of sports rooted in street culture such as basketball.

### Dependent Variables
1)Prevalence of addictive usage among teenagers. 

2)Incidents of crimes that are associated with street culture.



The corresponding data for each metric will be:

1)Percentage of Rap/Hip-Hop market share of total UK music market

2)Google searching trends for online shopping

3)Number of streetball events in the UK

4)Percentage of teenagers reporting drug use

5)Police-recorded rate of crimes among teenagers

All of this data will be collected from databases of the UK and evaluated in terms of reliability.

1)Data tables containing the annual market share percentages will be extracted from the BPI (British Phonographic Industry) Annual Reports and press releases, often in collaboration with the Official Charts Company.

2)Fashion trends data will be colelcted from the Google Trends Tool. Search interests for relevant keywords will be collected.

3)Reports from FIBA 3X3 or equivalent street sports will be evaluated

4)Time series data of addivtive usage will be extracted from the UK databases

5)Crime reports of teenagers in the UK will be evaluated

## Hypothesis
The hypothesis of this project will focus on the correlation of the observed data rather than direct causation, so the Null Hypothesis will be:

There is no statistically significant correlation between the rising popularity of street culture metrics and the prevalence of social deterioration among teenagers in the UK over the analysis period.

On the other hand the Alternative Hypothesis will be:

There is a statistically significant positive linear correlation between the rising popularity of street culture metrics and the prevalence of social deterioration among teenagers in the UK over the analysis period.
